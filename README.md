<h1 align="center">Aurora Assistant</h1>

<p align="center">I just tried to create a "Jarvis" like bot that listens to the commands and gives the output Using OpenAI and Google Text to speech APIs .....But that what alexa does whats the difference, To make it different from all the other youtube jarvic bot, I will use my Animation and cartooning skills to make a little avatar for aurora....I even plan to make a <strong>custom Voice model</strong> train on <strong>Brie Larson</strong></p>

## How to Try it out!!??


- First You Need to make **OpenAI API** key

    I am Making my key public just for the resume....But after that you have to make by yourself

    - Go to OpenAI Developor page - [here](https://openai.com/product)

    - And you will figure it out I guess. 


- Install the Python3x 
    
    - I think I have explain it -  [here](https://github.com/Vanshanium/Automate)
    - Install **request** Library for python 

            pip install requests 

    - The code will install all the external dependencies automatically.If any error occur try again the code or 

            Install all this manually
            
            pip install openai playsound sounddevice wave gtts numpy




- In Case You get an error due to portaudio then try this command in linux 

        sudo apt install libportaudio2

    In windows it already installed.
